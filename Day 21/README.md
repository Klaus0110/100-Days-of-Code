# Arrays
Today, I learnt about the concept of merging two arrays.

## Task
Take two arrays as input. the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.

## Example
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5, 6, 7]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
```
Input: [9, 3, 5] and [1, 16, 2]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 16]
```

## Input Format
Two integers denoting the number of elements in the arrays.<br>
Elements of both the arrays.

## Test Cases

* **Case 1**

Input
```
Enter the number of elements in array1: 4
Enter the elements: 
1
2
3
4
Enter the number of elements in array2: 3
Enter the elements: 
5
6
7
```
Output
```
Arrays after merging: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
```

* **Case 2**

Input
```
Enter the number of elements in array1: 3
Enter the elements: 
9
3
5
Enter the number of elements in array2: 3
Enter the elements: 
1
16
2
```
Output
```
Arrays after merging: 
1 2 3 5 9 16 
```
