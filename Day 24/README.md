# Arrays
Today, I learnt about the concept of finding missing element in an array.

## Task
Given an array arr[] of size N-1 with integers in the range of [1, N], the task is to find the missing number from the first N integers.<br>
Note: There are no duplicates in the list.

## Example
```
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}, N = 8
Output: 5
Explanation: The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5
```

## Input Format
An integer n to tell the length of array and an array of length n.

## Test Cases
* **Case 1**

Input
```
Enter the number of elements in the array: 7
Enter the elements: 
1
2
4
6
3
7
8
```
Output
```
The misssing number is: 
5
```

* **Case 2**

Input
```

Enter the elements:
