# Arrays
Today, I learnt about the concept of inversion counter in array.

## Task
Given an array a[]. The task is to find the inversion count of a[]. Where two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.

## Example
```
Input: arr[] = {8, 4, 2, 1}
Output: 6
Explanation: Given array has six inversions: (8, 4), (4, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1).
```

## Input Format
An integer n to tell the length of array, an array of length n..

## Test Cases
* **Case 1**

Input
```
Enter the number of elements in the array: 4
Enter the elements: 
8
4
2
1
```
Output
```
Number of inversions are 6
```

* **Case 2**

Input
```
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements: 
1
20
6
4
5
```
Output
```
Number of inversions are 5
```
