# Matrix Traversal
Two common ways of traversing a matrix are row-major-order and column-major-order.
* Row Major: When matrix is accessed row by row.
* Column Major: When matrix is accessed column by column.

## Example
```
Input : mat[][] = {{1, 2, 3}, 
                   {4, 5, 6}, 
                   {7, 8, 9}}

Output : Row-wise: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
         Col-wise : 1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 9
```

## Task
Showing the difference in time complexity using Python.
