# Idempotent Matrix
A matrix is said to be idempotent matrix if matrix multiplied by itself return the same matrix. The matrix M is said to be idempotent matrix if and only if M * M = M. In idempotent matrix M is a square matrix.

## Task
Given a N * N matrix and the task is to check matrix is idempotent matrix or not.

## Example
```
Input : mat[][] = {{3, -6},  {1, -2}};
Output: Idempotent Matrix

Input : mat[N][N] = {{2, -2, -4}, {-1, 3, 4}, {1, -2, -3}}
Output : Idempotent Matrix.
```
