# Counters
Counter is a container included in the collections module.<br>
Containers are objects that hold objects. They provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them. A Counter is a subclass of dict. Therefore it is an unordered collection where elements and their respective count are stored as a dictionary.

## Initialization
The constructor of counter can be called in any one of the following ways : 
* With sequence of items
* With dictionary containing keys and counts
* With keyword arguments mapping string names to counts
