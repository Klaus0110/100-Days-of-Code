# OrderedDict in Python
An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. The only difference between dict() and OrderedDict() is that:<br>

OrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. A regular dict doesnâ€™t track the insertion order and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order. By contrast, the order the items are inserted is remembered by OrderedDict.
