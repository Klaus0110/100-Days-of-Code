# User Dict
Python supports a dictionary like a container called UserDict present in the collections module. This class acts as a wrapper class around the dictionary objects. This class is useful when one wants to create a dictionary of their own with some modified functionality or with some new functionality. It can be considered as a way of adding new behaviors to the dictionary. This class takes a dictionary instance as an argument and simulates a dictionary that is kept in a regular dictionary. The dictionary is accessible by the data attribute of this class.
